 Next Steps for Notification System
You mentioned "we're not receiving any notification that the time slot has been booked". Let me know if you want me to implement:

Option A: Toast Notifications (Quick)
Show success/error toast after form submission
Client-side immediate feedback
Option B: Email Notifications (Complete)
Customer confirmation email
Provider notification email
With appointment details and calendar file
Option C: Both
Immediate toast feedback
Plus email notifications in background
Which would you prefer? Or would you like me to implement a different notification approach?
