# Repository Security & IP Protection Guide

## üîí Branch Protection Strategy

### Recommended GitHub Branch Protection Rules for `main`:

1. **Enable Branch Protection Rules:**
   - Go to: Repository Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add Rule
   - Branch name pattern: `main`

2. **Required Settings:**
   - ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require approvals (at least 1)
   - ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
   - ‚úÖ Require review from code owners
   - ‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ‚úÖ Include administrators (even you must follow the rules)

3. **Advanced Protection:**
   - ‚úÖ Restrict who can push to matching branches
   - ‚úÖ Allow force pushes: NO
   - ‚úÖ Allow deletions: NO

## üõ°Ô∏è IP Protection Measures

### 1. Repository Visibility
- Keep repository **PRIVATE** (currently appears to be private)
- Only invite trusted collaborators
- Use GitHub Teams for granular access control

### 2. Code Signing & Verification
- Enable GitHub's "Require signed commits"
- Set up GPG key signing for all commits
- Enable GitHub's vigilant mode

### 3. Sensitive Data Protection
- Add comprehensive .gitignore
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement pre-commit hooks
- Regular secret scanning

### 4. Access Control
- Enable 2FA for all collaborators
- Use GitHub App tokens instead of personal tokens
- Implement least-privilege access
- Regular access audits

## üîê Application Security Hardening

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Separate configs for dev/staging/production
- Secure database credentials
- API key management
- SSL/TLS implementation

### 2. Code Protection
- Code obfuscation for production
- License headers in all files
- Copyright notices
- Terms of service integration

### 3. Security Headers & Middleware
- CSRF protection (already implemented)
- XSS protection
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting
- Session security

### 4. Monitoring & Logging
- Security event logging
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Unusual activity detection
- Regular security audits

## üìã Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions:
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Enable signed commits
- [ ] Review repository collaborators
- [ ] Audit sensitive files in git history

### Security Hardening:
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging
- [ ] Add security headers
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Create incident response plan

### Legal Protection:
- [ ] Add LICENSE file
- [ ] Include copyright notices
- [ ] Create terms of service
- [ ] Document proprietary algorithms

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If IP is Compromised:
1. Immediately revoke all access tokens
2. Change all passwords and API keys  
3. Review git commit history
4. Contact GitHub support if needed
5. Legal consultation if necessary

### Incident Response:
1. Document the incident
2. Assess the scope of compromise
3. Implement containment measures
4. Notify stakeholders
5. Conduct post-incident review
