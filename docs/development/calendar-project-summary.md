3. **Recurring Appointments:** Support weekly/monthly recurring bookings
4. **Conflict Prevention:** Automatic rejection of conflicting bookings
5. **Notifications:** Email/SMS reminders for upcoming appointments
6. **Export:** Calendar export (iCal, PDF, Excel)
7. **Search:** Global search across appointments
8. **Analytics:** Booking trends, revenue reports
9. **Multi-Calendar:** View multiple providers' calendars overlayed
10. **Waitlist:** Support for booking on full slots
