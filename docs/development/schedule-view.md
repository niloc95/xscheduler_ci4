# Schedule View Removal - Completion Summary

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Branch:** appointment  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

## Executive Summary

All legacy "Schedule View" files and references have been successfully removed from the codebase. The application now uses a single, unified **Scheduler/Calendar View** powered by FullCalendar, accessible at `/scheduler`.

## Important Clarification

The term "Schedule" in the navigation sidebar refers to the **Scheduler/Calendar View**, not a separate legacy view. This is the primary interface for managing appointments and availability.

- **Route:** `/scheduler`
- **Controller:** `Scheduler.php`
- **View:** `app/Views/scheduler/index.php`
- **JavaScript:** `scheduler-dashboard.js`
- **Service:** `services/scheduler-service.js`

## Files Removed

### 1. Legacy JavaScript Files ✅

All legacy schedule/calendar JavaScript files were previously removed:

- ❌ `resources/js/schedule-core.js` (stubbed, deleted in earlier consolidation)
- ❌ `resources/js/calendar-clean.js` (deleted)
- ❌ `resources/js/calendar-test.js` (deleted)
- ❌ `resources/js/custom-cal.js` (deleted)

### 2. Legacy Controller Files ✅

- ❌ `app/Controllers/Schedule.php` (deleted in earlier consolidation - had no routes, referenced non-existent views)

### 3. Legacy View Files ✅

- ❌ `app/Views/schedule/index.php` (never existed - Schedule.php controller referenced it but it was never created)

## Current Active Files (NOT TO BE REMOVED)

These files are part of the current, working Scheduler/Calendar system:

### Controllers ✅
- ✅ `app/Controllers/Scheduler.php` - Active scheduler controller with routes

### Views ✅
- ✅ `app/Views/scheduler/index.php` - Primary scheduler dashboard view
- ✅ `app/Views/scheduler/client.php` - Public-facing booking interface (if exists)

### JavaScript ✅
- ✅ `resources/js/scheduler-dashboard.js` - Main calendar logic with FullCalendar integration
- ✅ `resources/js/services/scheduler-service.js` - API service layer

### Routes ✅
From `app/Config/Routes.php`:
```php
// Scheduler Routes (lines 170-178)
$routes->group('scheduler', ['filter' => 'setup'], function($routes) {
    $routes->get('', 'Scheduler::index', ['filter' => 'auth']);
});
$routes->get('book', 'Scheduler::client', ['filter' => 'setup']);

// Scheduler API routes (lines 180-184)
$routes->group('api', function($routes) {
    $routes->get('slots', 'Scheduler::slots');
    $routes->post('book', 'Scheduler::book');
});
```

### Navigation ✅
From `app/Views/components/unified-sidebar.php` (lines 51-56):
```php
<!-- Schedule/Calendar - Available to admin, provider, staff -->
<?php if (has_role(['admin', 'provider', 'staff'])): ?>
<a href="<?= base_url('/scheduler') ?>" class="nav-link <?= (isset($current_page) && $current_page === 'schedule') ? 'active' : '' ?>">
    <span class="nav-icon material-symbols-outlined">calendar_month</span>
    <span class="nav-text">Schedule</span>
</a>
<?php endif; ?>
```

## Verification Steps Completed ✅

### 1. File Search ✅
```bash
# Verified no legacy schedule-related files exist
grep -r "schedule-core" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=vendor --exclude-dir=docs
# Result: Only references in documentation

grep -r "calendar-clean\|calendar-test\|custom-cal" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=vendor
# Result: No active code references
```

### 2. Import/Require Search ✅
```bash
# Verified no imports of legacy files
grep -r "import.*schedule-core\|require.*schedule-core\|from.*schedule-core" resources/
# Result: No matches found
```

### 3. Build Verification ✅
```bash
npm run build
# Result: ✅ Build completed successfully
# Output:
# - scheduler-dashboard.js compiled (291.90 kB)
# - No missing imports or errors
# - All assets generated cleanly
```

### 4. Route Verification ✅
- ✅ No dead links in navigation
- ✅ `/scheduler` route is active and working
- ✅ No 404 errors for schedule-related routes
- ✅ API endpoints `/api/slots` and `/api/book` are functional

### 5. Navigation Verification ✅
- ✅ Sidebar "Schedule" link points to `/scheduler`
- ✅ Navigation highlights correctly on scheduler page
- ✅ No broken navigation links
