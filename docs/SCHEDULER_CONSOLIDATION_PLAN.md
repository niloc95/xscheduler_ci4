# Scheduler Consolidation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- `/scheduler` route ‚Üí `Scheduler::custom()` ‚Üí `scheduler/custom.php` view
- `scheduler-dashboard.js` loads and initializes FullCalendar correctly
- API endpoints: `/api/v1/appointments`, `/api/slots`, `/api/book`

### ‚ùå What's Broken/Redundant
- `Schedule.php` controller references non-existent `schedule/index` view
- `Scheduler::dashboard()` method has no corresponding view file
- No routes mapped to `Schedule.php`
- Multiple naming inconsistencies (Schedule vs Scheduler)

---

## Consolidation Strategy

### Phase 1: Remove Dead Code ‚úÇÔ∏è

**Delete:**
1. `app/Controllers/Schedule.php` - references non-existent view, no routes
2. Create missing view for `Scheduler::dashboard()` OR remove the method

**Reasoning:**
- `Schedule.php` is completely unused (no routes, no view)
- Keeping it causes confusion and maintenance burden
- Single source of truth: `Scheduler.php`

---

### Phase 2: Standardize Controller Structure üèóÔ∏è

**Keep `Scheduler.php` as the single scheduler controller with:**

```php
class Scheduler extends BaseController
{
    // Admin/staff full-featured dashboard
    public function index()
    {
        // Rename 'custom()' to 'index()' for RESTful convention
        // This becomes the default scheduler view
    }
    
    // Public client-facing booking interface
    public function client()
    {
        // Keep as-is for public bookings
    }
    
    // API endpoints
    public function slots() { /* ... */ }
    public function book() { /* ... */ }
}
```

**Changes:**
- Rename `custom()` ‚Üí `index()` (RESTful standard)
- Remove `dashboard()` method (unused, no view)
- Update routes accordingly

---

### Phase 3: Clean Up Views üßπ

**Current:**
- `app/Views/scheduler/custom.php` (working)

**Proposed:**
- Rename to `app/Views/scheduler/index.php` (matches controller method)
- OR keep `custom.php` and create `index.php` as alias/redirect

---

### Phase 4: Finalize JavaScript Architecture üì¶

**Single Calendar Script:**
- `resources/js/scheduler-dashboard.js` - **KEEP** (main calendar logic)
- `resources/js/schedule-core.js` - **STUBBED** (legacy warning)
- Delete stub after confirming no references

**Structure:**
```javascript
scheduler-dashboard.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Imports FullCalendar modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Fetches settings from API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Normalizes datetime strings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Maps appointments to events
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Initializes calendar with localization
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Handles UI interactions (filters, navigation)
```

**No duplication:**
- All event parsing in one place
- All FullCalendar config in one place
- Settings fetched once from `/api/v1/settings`

---

### Phase 5: Update Routes üõ£Ô∏è

**Current:**
```php
$routes->group('scheduler', ['filter' => 'setup'], function($routes) {
    $routes->get('', 'Scheduler::custom', ['filter' => 'auth']);
    $routes->get('dashboard', 'Scheduler::dashboard', ['filter' => 'auth']);
});
```

**Proposed:**
```php
$routes->group('scheduler', ['filter' => 'setup'], function($routes) {
    $routes->get('', 'Scheduler::index', ['filter' => 'auth']);
    // Remove 'dashboard' route (no view exists)
});
```

### Step 6: Test Routes ‚úÖ
- [x] `/scheduler` ‚Üí loads calendar correctly
- [x] `/book` ‚Üí loads public booking interface
- [x] Verify auth/role filters work

### Step 7: Documentation ‚úÖ
- [x] Create SCHEDULER_ARCHITECTURE.md (comprehensive architecture diagram)

- [x] Document API endpoints
- [x] Create developer guide for extending scheduler
- [x] Add troubleshooting guide
- [x] Add testing checklist

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- Deleting `Schedule.php` (no routes, no view, completely unused)
- Removing `Scheduler::dashboard()` (no view file)
- Renaming `custom()` ‚Üí `index()` (internal only)

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Renaming view file (check for any hardcoded references)
- Route changes (verify all navigation links)

### Mitigation
- Keep old view as symlink during transition
- Add redirect from old route to new route
- Comprehensive testing after each change

---

## Post-Consolidation Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One controller, one view, one JS file
2. **RESTful Convention**: `Scheduler::index()` as default
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Performance**: No duplicate logic or redundant requests
5. **Debugging**: Easier to trace issues with unified structure

---

## Timeline

- **Phase 1-2**: 30 minutes (remove dead code)
- **Phase 3-4**: 1 hour (rename & verify)
- **Phase 5**: 30 minutes (route updates)
- **Testing**: 1 hour (comprehensive verification)

**Total**: ~3 hours for complete consolidation

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] Only one controller handles scheduler logic (`Scheduler.php`)
- [x] Only one view file for admin scheduler (`scheduler/index.php`)
- [x] Only one JavaScript file for calendar (`scheduler-dashboard.js`)
- [x] All routes work correctly
- [x] Day/Week/Month views render appointments properly
- [x] Filters and navigation function
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Localization respected (time format, timezone, first day)
- [x] Build verified with no regressions
- [x] Comprehensive documentation added

2. **Delete prototypes promptly to avoid confusion**
   - 4 legacy calendar scripts were causing maintenance issues
   
3. **Follow RESTful conventions from the start**
   - Renaming `custom()` ‚Üí `index()` aligns with framework standards
   
4. **Document architecture during development, not after**
   - Created 15 documentation files for maintainability
   
5. **Single source of truth prevents bugs**
   - Consolidated calendar logic fixed multiple rendering issues
