## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Color System ✅

**Implementation:**
- Colors are dynamically assigned based on appointment attributes:
  - **Status-based coloring** (highest priority):
    - Confirmed: Emerald green
    - Cancelled: Rose red
    - Booked/Pending: Amber yellow
    - Completed: Slate gray
  - **Service-based coloring** (when no status):
    - 8 distinct color palettes rotating by service ID
  - **Provider-based coloring** (fallback):
    - 8 distinct color palettes with offset for variety

**Color Palette:**
```javascript
- Cyan, Fuchsia, Lime, Indigo, Orange, Pink, Teal, Violet
- Each with light/dark mode variants
- High contrast borders for definition
```

**Benefits:**
- Instant visual identification of appointment types
- Consistent color associations help users build mental models
- Accessibility-friendly contrast ratios

### 2. Enhanced Spacing & Typography ✅

**Changes:**

#### Event Pills (Appointment Blocks)
- **Padding:** Increased from `px-3 py-2` to `px-4 py-3`
- **Gap:** Increased from `gap-1` to `gap-2` between elements
- **Border:** Upgraded from `border` to `border-2` for stronger definition
- **Min Height:** 
  - Day Grid: 60px minimum
  - Time Grid: 80px minimum
  - Mobile: 50px minimum

#### Calendar Grid
- **Day Cell Height:** Increased from 120px to 140px in month view
- **Cell Padding:** Increased from `p-2` to `p-3`
- **Event Spacing:** Increased margin between events from 1px to 2px

#### Typography Hierarchy
```css
Client Name:     font-bold text-base (prominent)
Service Name:    text-sm font-semibold opacity-90
Provider Name:   text-xs font-medium opacity-75
Time:            text-xs font-semibold opacity-90
Status Badge:    text-[10px] font-bold uppercase
```

**Benefits:**
- Clearer visual hierarchy
- Reduced eye strain

### 3. Improved Event Content Structure ✅

**New Layout:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ● Title                      9:00 AM    │  ← Header row
│                                         │
│ John Doe                                │  ← Client (bold, prominent)
│                                         │
│ Haircut & Style                         │  ← Service (semi-bold)
│                                         │
│ with Sarah Johnson                      │  ← Provider (lighter)
│                                         │
│ ● CONFIRMED                             │  ← Status badge
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**
- Status dot with subtle shadow effect
- Time displayed in header (right-aligned)
- Clear visual separation between sections
- Status badge at bottom with pill styling

**Benefits:**
- Information scans naturally top-to-bottom
- Most important details (client, service) are prominent

### 4. Enhanced Hover States & Interactions ✅

**Hover Effects:**
```css
Default:  shadow-sm
Hover:    shadow-lg + scale-[1.02]
Duration: 200ms ease-in-out
```

**Comprehensive Tooltips:**
- Multi-line format showing all details:
  ```
  Appointment Title
  Client: John Doe
  Service: Haircut & Style
  Provider: Sarah Johnson
  Status: confirmed
  Time: 9:00 AM
  ```

**Benefits:**
- Tactile feedback improves perceived responsiveness

**Benefits:**

**Examples:**

Light: bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 border-emerald-200
