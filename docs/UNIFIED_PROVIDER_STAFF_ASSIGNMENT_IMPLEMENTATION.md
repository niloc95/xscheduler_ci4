# Unified Provider↔Staff Assignment System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a unified bidirectional assignment system using a pivot table approach, replacing the legacy single-column `users.provider_id` system. This allows flexible many-to-many relationships where:
- Providers can have multiple assigned staff members
- Staff members can work for multiple providers

## Architecture Components

### Database Layer
**Table: `xs_provider_staff_assignments`**
- Pivot table with columns: `provider_id`, `staff_id`, `assigned_at`
- Unique constraint on `(provider_id, staff_id)` prevents duplicates
- Foreign keys with CASCADE delete maintain referential integrity
- Migration backfilled existing assignments from legacy `users.provider_id` column

### Model Layer
**File: `app/Models/ProviderStaffModel.php`**
- **Bidirectional Queries:**
  - `getStaffByProvider($providerId)` - Get all staff assigned to a provider
  - `getProvidersForStaff($staffId)` - Get all providers a staff member works for
  
- **Assignment Management:**
  - `assignStaff($providerId, $staffId)` - Create assignment (both directions use same method)
  - `removeStaff($providerId, $staffId)` - Delete assignment
  - `isStaffAssignedToProvider($staffId, $providerId)` - Check relationship exists

### Controller Layer
**Two Symmetric Controllers:**

**1. `app/Controllers/ProviderStaff.php`** (Provider → Staff direction)
- Routes: `/provider-staff/*`
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /provider-staff/provider/{id}` - List staff for a provider
  - `POST /provider-staff/assign` - Assign staff to provider
  - `POST /provider-staff/remove` - Remove staff from provider
- Authorization: Admin or owning provider can view; admin can modify

**2. `app/Controllers/StaffProviders.php`** (Staff → Provider direction)
- Routes: `/staff-providers/*`
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /staff-providers/staff/{id}` - List providers for a staff member
  - `POST /staff-providers/assign` - Assign provider to staff
  - `POST /staff-providers/remove` - Remove provider from staff
- Authorization: Admin or owning staff can view; admin can modify

Both controllers use the same underlying `ProviderStaffModel` methods - they just present different views of the same bidirectional relationship.

### View Components
**Two Symmetric UI Components:**

**1. `app/Views/user_management/components/provider_staff.php`**
- Displayed when editing provider users
- Shows assigned staff members
- Allows admin to assign/remove staff
- JavaScript handles CSRF, dynamic updates, toast notifications

**2. `app/Views/user_management/components/staff_providers.php`**
- Displayed when editing staff/receptionist users
- Shows assigned providers
- Allows admin to assign/remove providers
- Mirrors provider_staff.php functionality

Both components:
- Handle missing user IDs gracefully
- Use ES5-compatible JavaScript (no optional chaining)
- Include `credentials: 'same-origin'` for CSRF tokens
- Dynamically update select dropdowns after assignment changes
- Format timestamps with humanized relative dates

### Integration with User Management
**File: `app/Controllers/UserManagement.php`**

**edit() Method:**
```php
// Provider role: Load assigned staff
if ($user['role'] === 'provider') {
    $assignedStaff = $this->providerStaffModel->getStaffByProvider($user['id']);
    $availableStaff = // get all staff/receptionist users
}
// Staff/Receptionist role: Load assigned providers
elseif (in_array($user['role'], ['staff', 'receptionist'])) {
    $assignedProviders = $this->providerStaffModel->getProvidersForStaff($user['id']);
    $availableProviders = // get all provider users
}
```

**store() and update() Methods:**
- ✅ Removed all `provider_id` validation rules
- ✅ Removed all writes to `users.provider_id` column
- ✅ Assignments now handled exclusively via assignment components after user creation

**Views Updated:**
- ✅ Removed provider selection dropdown from `create.php`
- ✅ Removed provider selection dropdown from `edit.php`
- ✅ Updated role description for staff to mention "assignments managed after creation"

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Build Dual System (Completed)
1. ✅ Created pivot table with backfill migration
2. ✅ Built ProviderStaffModel with bidirectional methods
3. ✅ Created symmetric controllers for both directions
4. ✅ Added routes with role-based filters
5. ✅ Built UI components for both provider and staff views

### Phase 2: Deprecate Legacy Column (Completed)
1. ✅ Removed provider_id from UserManagement::store()
2. ✅ Removed provider_id from UserManagement::update()
3. ✅ Removed provider_id dropdowns from create/edit views
4. ✅ Updated JavaScript to remove provider selection logic
5. ✅ Column remains in database for backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Current)
- Build assets: ✅ Successful
- Manual testing needed:
  1. Create new provider → assign staff via provider_staff component
  2. Create new staff → assign providers via staff_providers component
  3. Edit existing provider → verify staff list loads correctly
  4. Edit existing staff → verify provider list loads correctly
  5. Test bidirectional sync (assign from provider side, verify staff side shows it)
  6. Test assignment removal from both directions
  7. Check calendar/schedule permissions still work

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Two Controllers Instead of One?
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each controller handles one direction of the relationship
- **Clear Authorization:** Provider-side requires provider/admin roles; staff-side requires staff/admin
- **Symmetric API:** Both sides have identical endpoint patterns (list/assign/remove)
- **Future Flexibility:** Easy to add role-specific business logic without coupling

### Why Pivot Table Instead of JSON Column?
- **Referential Integrity:** Foreign keys prevent orphaned assignments
- **Query Performance:** Indexed joins faster than JSON parsing
- **Standardization:** Follows established many-to-many pattern
- **Auditability:** `assigned_at` timestamp tracks when relationships formed

### Why Keep Legacy Column?
- **Zero-Downtime Migration:** Existing queries don't break immediately
- **Rollback Safety:** Can revert if critical issues found
- **Gradual Transition:** Reports/analytics can migrate at own pace
- **Future Removal:** Can drop column in later release after verification period

## Testing Checklist

### Provider → Staff Direction
- [ ] Create provider user
- [ ] Edit provider user → see empty staff list
- [ ] Assign staff member to provider via dropdown
- [ ] Verify staff appears in provider's assigned list
- [ ] Remove staff assignment
- [ ] Verify staff disappears from list

### Staff → Provider Direction
- [ ] Create staff user
- [ ] Edit staff user → see empty provider list
- [ ] Assign provider to staff via dropdown
- [ ] Verify provider appears in staff's assigned list
- [ ] Remove provider assignment
- [ ] Verify provider disappears from list

### Bidirectional Sync
- [ ] Assign staff to provider from provider edit screen
- [ ] Navigate to staff edit screen → verify provider appears
- [ ] Remove assignment from staff edit screen
- [ ] Navigate back to provider edit screen → verify staff removed

### Authorization
- [ ] Login as provider → verify can view own staff list (read-only)
- [ ] Login as staff → verify can view own provider list (read-only)
- [ ] Login as admin → verify can assign/remove from both sides
- [ ] Verify non-admin cannot access assign/remove endpoints

### JavaScript/UI
- [ ] Verify dropdown updates after assignment
- [ ] Verify toast notifications appear on success/error
- [ ] Verify "already assigned" appears in dropdown for existing assignments
- [ ] Verify humanized timestamps display correctly
- [ ] Test in multiple browsers (check ES5 compatibility)

### Database Integrity
- [ ] Query pivot table directly → verify assignments persist
- [ ] Delete provider → verify CASCADE deletes assignments
- [ ] Delete staff → verify CASCADE deletes assignments
- [ ] Attempt duplicate assignment → verify UNIQUE constraint prevents it

## Files Modified

### New Files Created

- `app/Controllers/StaffProviders.php` (API for staff→provider)
- `app/Database/Migrations/2025-10-17-000002_CreateProviderStaffAssignments.php` (already existed)

### Existing Files Modified
- `app/Controllers/UserManagement.php`
  - Added `assignedProviders`, `availableProviders`, `staffId` to edit() data
  - Removed provider_id validation from store()
  - Removed provider_id assignment logic from update()
  
- `app/Views/user_management/edit.php`
  - Removed provider_id dropdown section
  - Added conditional include for staff_providers component
  - Removed JavaScript for provider selection toggle
  
- `app/Views/user_management/create.php`
  - Removed provider_id dropdown section
  - Updated staff role description
  - Removed JavaScript for provider selection toggle

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing:** Follow testing checklist above
2. **Verify CSRF Protection:** Ensure all fetch calls include credentials
3. **Browser Compatibility:** Test JavaScript in Safari, Firefox, Chrome
4. **Performance Check:** Monitor query performance with large datasets
5. **Documentation:** Update user-facing help docs about assignment workflow
6. **Future Enhancement:** Consider batch assignment UI for bulk operations

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If critical issues discovered:
1. Revert UserManagement controller changes (restore provider_id logic)
2. Revert create.php and edit.php view changes (restore dropdowns)
3. Remove staff-providers routes
4. Delete StaffProviders.php controller
5. Delete staff_providers.php component
6. Pivot table can remain (doesn't interfere with legacy system)

Migration can be re-attempted after issues resolved.
