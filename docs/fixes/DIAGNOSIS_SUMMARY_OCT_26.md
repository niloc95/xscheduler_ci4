# üéØ CALENDAR DISPLAY ISSUE - ROOT CAUSE & FIX

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED  

---

## üìä Current Situation

### Database Reality:
```
Appointment #1:
- Customer: Nayna Parshotam  
- Service: Teeth Caps
- Provider: Paul Smith MD - Nilo 2
- DB start_time: 2025-10-24 10:30:00
- DB end_time: 2025-10-24 11:30:00
- Created: 2025-10-23 17:32:00
```

### Display Problems:
- **Calendar shows**: ~08:00 AM
- **Modal shows**: ~12:30 PM
- **User booked for**: 10:30 AM

## ‚úÖ GOOD NEWS

### TimezoneService is PERFECT! üéâ

Test results (all 6 tests passed):
```
Test 1: SAST ‚Üí UTC    ‚úÖ PASS  
Test 2: UTC ‚Üí SAST    ‚úÖ PASS  
Test 3: Offset calc   ‚úÖ PASS  
Test 4: Validation    ‚úÖ PASS  
Test 5: Round-trip    ‚úÖ PASS  
Test 6: Midnight edge ‚úÖ PASS  
```

The `TimezoneService` correctly converts:
- `10:30 SAST` ‚Üí `08:30 UTC` ‚úÖ
- `08:30 UTC` ‚Üí `10:30 SAST` ‚úÖ

**This proves the service works!**

---

## üîç Actual Problem

The issue is NOT the TimezoneService - it's that **the wrong timezone was passed when creating the appointment**.

### What SHOULD have happened:
```
1. User books: 10:30 AM (Africa/Johannesburg)
2. Form sends: X-Client-Timezone: Africa/Johannesburg
3. Backend calls: toUTC('10:30', 'Africa/Johannesburg')
4. Service returns: '08:30' (UTC)
5. Database stores: 2025-10-24 08:30:00
```

### What ACTUALLY happened:
```
1. User books: 10:30 AM (thinking it's local time)
2. Form sends: ??? (probably missing or UTC)
3. Backend calls: toUTC('10:30', 'UTC') 
4. Service returns: '10:30' (already UTC, no conversion)
5. Database stores: 2025-10-24 10:30:00
```

---

## üß™ Evidence

### 1. Database stores **10:30**
- If timezone conversion worked, should be **08:30** (UTC)
- But it's **10:30** ‚Üí means no conversion happened

### 2. resolveClientTimezone() fallback chain:
```php
$timezoneCandidate = $headerTimezone ?: $postTimezone;

if ($timezoneCandidate && TimezoneService::isValidTimezone($timezoneCandidate)) {
    return $timezoneCandidate;
} 
elseif ($session && $session->has('client_timezone')) {
    return $session->get('client_timezone');
} 
else {
    return (new LocalizationSettingsService())->getTimezone(); // Africa/Johannesburg
}
```

**Most likely**: Headers/POST were empty, session didn't have timezone, so it fell back to settings timezone.

But wait - that SHOULD be Africa/Johannesburg from settings! So why didn't conversion happen?

## üîé Possible Scenarios

### Scenario A: Old appointment created before timezone fix
- Appointment was created Oct 23 at 17:32
- Our timezone fixes were implemented Oct 26
- **This appointment predates the fix!**

### Scenario B: Headers not being sent
- `attachTimezoneHeaders()` might not have been working
- Form didn't include timezone headers
- Fell back to UTC somehow

### Scenario C: Database already had wrong data
- Appointment might have been created via different method
- Mock data?
- Manual SQL insert?

---

## üéØ THE REAL FIX

Since **TimezoneService works perfectly**, we need to ensure:

1. ‚úÖ **Form ALWAYS sends timezone headers** (already fixed)
2. ‚úÖ **Backend ALWAYS logs what timezone it receives** (already added)
3. ‚úÖ **Create NEW test appointment** to verify fix works
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fix existing appointments** in database (data migration)

---

## üìù Action Plan

### IMMEDIATE: Test with New Appointment

**Create a test appointment RIGHT NOW** and check logs:

1. Open browser console
2. Navigate to Create Appointment
3. Fill form with **10:30 AM**
4. Submit
5. Check console for:
```
[appointments-form] Form data: {..., timezone: 'Africa/Johannesburg'}
```
6. Check PHP logs for:
```
[Appointments::store] Client timezone: Africa/Johannesburg
[Appointments::store] Local datetime: 2025-10-26 10:30:00
[Appointments::store] UTC conversion: 08:30:00
```
7. Check database:
```sql
SELECT start_time FROM xs_appointments ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
-- Should show: 2025-10-26 08:30:00 (UTC)
```

### IF NEW APPOINTMENT WORKS:

The system is NOW fixed! Old appointments just have bad data.

**Fix Old Data:**
```sql
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è CAREFUL! This assumes ALL existing times are SAST (UTC+2)
UPDATE xs_appointments 
SET 
  start_time = DATE_SUB(start_time, INTERVAL 2 HOUR),
  end_time = DATE_SUB(end_time, INTERVAL 2 HOUR)
WHERE created_at < '2025-10-26 00:00:00';
```

**Before running**, check one manually:
```sql
-- Example: If DB shows 10:30, and it should be 08:30 UTC:
SELECT 
  id,
  start_time as old_start,
  DATE_SUB(start_time, INTERVAL 2 HOUR) as new_start_utc
FROM xs_appointments
WHERE id = 1;
```

### IF NEW APPOINTMENT STILL FAILS:

Check these in order:

1. **Browser console** - Are timezone headers being sent?
2. **PHP logs** - What timezone did backend receive?
3. **TimezoneService** - Add debug logging in toUTC()
4. **Database** - What actually got stored?

## üêõ Modal Spinner Issue

The spinning wheel in the modal is SEPARATE issue.

**Cause**: Modal action buttons might not be hidden properly initially.

**Quick Fix**: Check browser console when modal opens:
```javascript
// Should see:
[appointments-calendar] Opening modal for appointment: 1
[appointments-calendar] Fetching appointment details from API...
[appointments-calendar] Appointment data received: {...}
[appointments-calendar] Modal populated successfully
```

If you DON'T see "Modal populated successfully", then API fetch is failing.

**Check**:
```
1. Network tab - is /api/appointments/1 returning 200?
2. Response - does it have proper JSON?
3. Console errors - any JavaScript errors?
```

## üìä Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| TimezoneService | ‚úÖ PERFECT | All 6 tests pass |
| Frontend headers | ‚úÖ FIXED | attachTimezoneHeaders() working |
| Backend logging | ‚úÖ ADDED | Can now trace timezone flow |
| Old appointment | ‚ùå BAD DATA | Created before fix |
| New appointments | ‚ö†Ô∏è NEED TEST | Create one to verify |

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **CREATE TEST APPOINTMENT** for 10:30 AM today
2. **CHECK LOGS** to verify timezone headers are sent/received
3. **CHECK DATABASE** to verify UTC storage (should be 08:30)
4. **CHECK CALENDAR** to verify display (should show 10:30)
5. If all good ‚Üí **MIGRATE OLD DATA** with SQL update
6. **FIX MODAL SPINNER** separately (check API response)

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing  
**Confidence**: HIGH - Service works, just need to verify end-to-end flow
