# Appointments Controller Consolidation

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Issue:** Multiple redundant Appointments controllers causing confusion  
**Solution:** Consolidated from 4 controllers down to 2 controllers

---

## Problem Summary

The codebase had **4 different Appointments controllers**:

1. `app/Controllers/Appointments.php` - Web controller (renders HTML pages)
2. `app/Controllers/Api/Appointments.php` - API with timezone handling
3. `app/Controllers/Api/V1/Appointments.php` - RESTful API v1
4. `app/Controllers/Api/Admin/V1/Appointments.php` - Admin API (unused)

This created:
- Route confusion (duplicate endpoints)
- Maintenance overhead (same logic in multiple places)
- Unclear API contracts for frontend developers
- Unused code accumulation

---

## Frontend API Usage Analysis

Grep search revealed actual frontend usage:

### Primary API Endpoints (All using `/api/appointments`)
- **scheduler-core.js**: `GET /api/appointments?start=&end=`
- **appointments-calendar.js**: `GET /api/appointments`, `GET /api/appointments/:id`, `PATCH /api/appointments/:id/status`
- **appointments-form.js**: `POST /api/appointments/check-availability`
- **scheduler-drag-drop.js**: `PATCH /api/appointments/:id`
- **appointment-modal.js**: `POST /api/v1/appointments` ⚠️ (needed update)

### Analysis Results
✅ **Api/Appointments.php** - Actively used by 5+ components  
⚠️ **Api/V1/Appointments.php** - Only used by appointment-modal.js (1 endpoint)  
❌ **Api/Admin/V1/Appointments.php** - No routes registered, completely unused

---

## Solution: Consolidated Architecture

### Final Structure (2 Controllers)

#### 1. **`app/Controllers/Appointments.php`** (Web Controller)
**Purpose:** Render HTML pages for appointments UI  
**Routes:**
- `GET /appointments` - List page
- `GET /appointments/create` - Create form page
- `POST /appointments/store` - Form submission handler
- `GET /appointments/view/:id` - Detail page

**Keep Because:** Essential for server-side rendering

---

#### 2. **`app/Controllers/Api/Appointments.php`** (Unified API)
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all appointment API operations  
**Routes:** `/api/appointments/*`

**Enhanced Features:**
```php
✅ Pagination support (page, length parameters)
✅ Sorting support (sort=field:direction)
✅ Date range filtering (start, end)
✅ Provider/service filtering (providerId, serviceId)
✅ Timezone awareness (UTC storage, client conversion)
✅ Full CRUD operations (index, show, create, update, delete)
✅ Availability checking (check-availability endpoint)
✅ Status management (updateStatus endpoint)
✅ Metrics endpoints (counts, summary)
```

**Endpoints:**
```
GET    /api/appointments              - List with pagination/filtering
GET    /api/appointments/:id          - Get single appointment
POST   /api/appointments              - Create appointment
PATCH  /api/appointments/:id          - Update appointment
DELETE /api/appointments/:id          - Cancel appointment
PATCH  /api/appointments/:id/status   - Update status only
POST   /api/appointments/check-availability - Check slot availability
GET    /api/appointments/counts       - Get counts (today/week/month)
GET    /api/appointments/summary      - Get summary (alias for counts)
```

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `Api/Appointments.php`
**Added from V1 controller:**
- Pagination logic (page, length, offset calculation)
- Sorting parameters (sort field validation, direction)
- Total count for pagination metadata
- `create()` method using SchedulingService
- `update()` method with PATCH support
- `delete()` method (soft cancel)
- `counts()` method with time period breakdowns
- `summary()` method (alias for counts)
- `countInRange()` helper method

**Improvements:**
```php
// BEFORE: No pagination
$appointments = $builder->get()->getResultArray();

// AFTER: Full pagination support
$page = max(1, (int)($this->request->getGet('page') ?? 1));
$length = min(100, max(1, (int)($this->request->getGet('length') ?? 50)));
$offset = ($page - 1) * $length;
$totalCount = $countBuilder->countAllResults(false);
$appointments = $builder->limit($length, $offset)->get()->getResultArray();
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "count": 10,
    "total": 124,
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 50,
    "sort": "start_time:asc",
    "filters": {
      "start": "2025-10-01",
      "end": "2025-10-31",
      "provider_id": null,
      "service_id": null
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated `Routes.php`
**Before:** Complex v1 routing with resource controller
```php
// Unversioned routes pointing to v1 controller
$routes->get('appointments', 'Api\\Appointments::index');
$routes->get('appointments/summary', 'Api\\V1\\Appointments::summary'); // Mixed!
$routes->resource('appointments', ['controller' => 'Api\\V1\\Appointments']);

// Versioned routes duplicating same logic
$routes->group('v1', function($routes) {
    $routes->resource('appointments', ['controller' => 'Api\\V1\\Appointments']);
});
```

**After:** Clean consolidated routing
```php
// All appointments routes use Api\Appointments controller
$routes->post('appointments', 'Api\\Appointments::create');
$routes->get('appointments/summary', 'Api\\Appointments::summary');
$routes->get('appointments/counts', 'Api\\Appointments::counts');
$routes->post('appointments/check-availability', 'Api\\Appointments::checkAvailability');
$routes->get('appointments/(:num)', 'Api\\Appointments::show/$1');
$routes->patch('appointments/(:num)', 'Api\\Appointments::update/$1');
$routes->delete('appointments/(:num)', 'Api\\Appointments::delete/$1');
$routes->patch('appointments/(:num)/status', 'Api\\Appointments::updateStatus/$1');
$routes->get('appointments', 'Api\\Appointments::index');
```

### 3. Updated `appointment-modal.js`
**Before:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/appointments', {
    method: 'POST',
    ...
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
    method: 'POST',
    ...
});
```

### 4. Deleted Redundant Files
```bash
✓ Deleted: app/Controllers/Api/V1/Appointments.php
✓ Deleted: app/Controllers/Api/Admin/V1/Appointments.php
```

## Testing Checklist

After consolidation, verify these scenarios:

- [ ] Scheduler loads appointments (month/week/day views)
- [ ] Click appointment shows detail modal
- [ ] Create appointment via modal works
- [ ] Drag-drop reschedule updates appointment
- [ ] Status change (confirm/cancel) works
- [ ] Availability check during booking works
- [ ] Dashboard counts/summary displays correctly
- [ ] Pagination works for large appointment lists
- [ ] Filtering by provider/service works
- [ ] Date range filtering works
- [ ] Timezone conversion displays correctly

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
⚠️ **Frontend breaking change:** Changed POST endpoint  
- **Old:** `POST /api/v1/appointments`  
- **New:** `POST /api/appointments`  
- **Impact:** Only appointment-modal.js (already updated)

### Backward Compatibility
✅ All existing `/api/appointments/*` routes maintained  
✅ No changes to web controller routes  
✅ Response formats preserved  
✅ Query parameter names unchanged

### Deployment
No special migration steps needed. Changes are code-only, no database schema changes.

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### Fixed Issues
✅ Removed undefined variable warnings (`$startParam`, `$endParam`)  
✅ Consistent error response format across all endpoints  
✅ Proper HTTP status codes (400, 404, 409, 500)  
✅ Input validation on all endpoints  
✅ Type safety with explicit casts

### Added Best Practices
✅ Dependency injection (SchedulingService)  
✅ Single Responsibility Principle (Web vs API separation)  
✅ DRY principle (shared logic in one place)  
✅ RESTful conventions (proper HTTP verbs)
