# User Edit Bug Fix - "Failed to Update User" Error

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Commit:** `4f899a3`  
**Branch:** `user-management`

---

## Issue Summary

When editing an existing user through the User Management interface, the form would display correctly and allow modifications. However, clicking "Update User" would result in:

- ❌ Redirect to Services view (incorrect)
- ❌ Error message: "Failed to update user. Please try again."
- ❌ Changes not saved to database

---

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Missing Role Validation in UserModel** ⚠️
**File:** `app/Models/UserModel.php`

```php
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
protected $validationRules = [
    'name'  => 'required|min_length[2]|max_length[255]',
    'email' => 'required|valid_email|is_unique[users.email,id,{id}]',
    'role'  => 'required|in_list[admin,provider,receptionist]' // ❌ Missing 'staff'!
];

// AFTER (FIXED):
protected $validationRules = [
    'name'  => 'required|min_length[2]|max_length[255]',
    'email' => 'required|valid_email|is_unique[users.email,id,{id}]',
    'role'  => 'required|in_list[admin,provider,staff,receptionist,customer]' // ✅ Complete
];
```

**Impact:** Any update to a user with `role='staff'` would fail model validation, causing the save to fail silently.

---

### 2. **Missing `is_active` Checkbox Handling** ⚠️
**File:** `app/Controllers/UserManagement.php` - `update()` method

```php
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
$updateData = [
    'name' => $this->request->getPost('name'),
    'email' => $this->request->getPost('email'),
    'phone' => $this->request->getPost('phone'),
];
// ❌ is_active not handled - checkbox unchecked = no value sent

// AFTER (FIXED):
$updateData = [
    'name' => $this->request->getPost('name'),
    'email' => $this->request->getPost('email'),
    'phone' => $this->request->getPost('phone'),
];
// ✅ Explicit handling: unchecked = false
$updateData['is_active'] = $this->request->getPost('is_active') ? true : false;
```

**Impact:** When the "Active User" checkbox was unchecked, no value was sent to the server. The field would remain unchanged in the database, making it impossible to deactivate users via the edit form.

---

### 3. **Incomplete Role Change Logic** ⚠️
**File:** `app/Controllers/UserManagement.php` - `update()` method

```php
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
if ($this->canChangeUserRole($currentUserId, $userId)) {
    $newRole = $this->request->getPost('role');
    if ($newRole !== $user['role']) { // ❌ Only updates if role changed
        if (!$this->canCreateRole($currentUserId, $newRole)) {
            return redirect()->back()
                           ->with('error', 'You do not have permission to assign this role.');
        }
        $updateData['role'] = $newRole;
    }
}

// AFTER (FIXED):
if ($this->canChangeUserRole($currentUserId, $userId)) {
    $newRole = $this->request->getPost('role');
    if ($newRole) { // ✅ Always set role if provided
        if ($newRole !== $user['role'] && !$this->canCreateRole($currentUserId, $newRole)) {
            return redirect()->back()
                           ->with('error', 'You do not have permission to assign this role.');
        }
        $updateData['role'] = $newRole;
    }
}
```

**Impact:** When updating a user without changing their role, the role field was omitted from `$updateData`. This could cause issues with the model validation requiring the role field.

---

### 4. **Improved Provider Assignment Logic** ✅
**File:** `app/Controllers/UserManagement.php` - `update()` method

```php
// AFTER (ENHANCED):
// Handle provider assignment for staff
$finalRole = $updateData['role'] ?? $user['role'];
if ($finalRole === 'staff') {
    $providerId = $this->request->getPost('provider_id');
    if ($providerId && $this->canAssignToProvider($currentUserId, $providerId)) {
        $updateData['provider_id'] = $providerId;
    } elseif (!$providerId && !$user['provider_id']) {
        // Staff requires a provider
        return redirect()->back()
                       ->with('error', 'Staff members must be assigned to a provider.');
    }
} else {
    // Clear provider_id if not staff
    $updateData['provider_id'] = null;
}
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Validates staff users have a provider assigned
- ✅ Clears provider assignment when changing from staff to another role
- ✅ Properly determines final role (from update or current)
