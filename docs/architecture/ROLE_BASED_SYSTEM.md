- status ENUM('active','inactive','suspended') DEFAULT 'active'
```

## Key Components Implemented

- **UserPermissionModel**: Handles role-based permissions and hierarchies

### 2. Filters
- **RoleFilter**: Route protection based on user roles
- **AuthFilter**: Enhanced authentication with role checks

### 3. Controllers
- **UserManagement**: Complete CRUD operations with role-based permissions
- **Auth**: Login/logout with role-based redirects

### 4. Views
- **Role-Based Sidebar**: Dynamic navigation based on user role
- **User Management**: CRUD interface with role-specific capabilities
- **Layout**: Updated to use role-based navigation

### 5. Helpers
- **permissions_helper.php**: Utility functions for role and permission checks

## Permissions System

### Role-Based Permissions
```php
// Admin permissions
- user_management: Create/edit/delete any user
- system_settings: Access system configuration
- create_admin: Create other admin users
- create_provider: Create service providers

// Provider permissions  
- create_staff: Create staff members assigned to them
- manage_services: Manage their own services
- view_analytics: Access their own analytics

// Staff permissions
- Limited to their own data and appointments

// Customer permissions
- Basic booking and profile management only
```

### Helper Functions
```php
- has_role($roles): Check if user has specific role(s)
- has_permission($permissions): Check specific permissions
- is_admin(), is_provider(), is_staff(), is_customer(): Role checks
- can_manage_users(): Check user management permissions
- get_user_hierarchy(): Get users that current user can manage
```

## Route Protection

### Role-Based Route Filters
```php
// Admin only routes
$routes->group('', ['filter' => 'role:admin'], function($routes) {
    $routes->get('/settings', 'Settings::index');
});

// Admin and Provider routes
$routes->group('', ['filter' => 'role:admin,provider'], function($routes) {
    $routes->resource('user-management', ['controller' => 'UserManagement']);
});
```

## Navigation System

### Dynamic Sidebar
- **Role-Based Menu Items**: Different navigation options for each role
- **Permission Checks**: Menu items only show if user has required permissions
- **User Context**: Shows current user info with role badge
- **Staff Count**: Providers see count of their assigned staff
- **Visual Indicators**: Role-specific colors and icons

### Menu Examples by Role

**Admin Navigation:**
- Dashboard, Schedule, Appointments, User Management, Services, Analytics, System Settings, Profile, Help

**Provider Navigation:**
- Dashboard, Schedule, Appointments, My Staff (with count), Services, My Analytics, Profile, Help

**Staff Navigation:**
- Dashboard, My Schedule, My Appointments, Profile, Help

**Customer Navigation:**
- Dashboard, My Appointments, Profile, Help

## Test Users Created

For testing the role-based system:

| Role | Email | Password | Description |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Admin | nilo.cara@gmail.com | (original) | Full system access |
| Provider | provider@test.com | password | Service provider demo |
| Staff | staff@test.com | password | Staff member (assigned to Provider) |
| Customer | customer@test.com | password | Customer demo |

## Security Features

### Access Control
- Route-level protection with role filters
- Controller-level permission checks
- View-level conditional rendering
- Database-level user hierarchy enforcement

### Data Isolation
- Staff can only see their own data
- Providers can only manage their assigned staff
- Customers can only see their own appointments
- Admins have full access to all data

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start Server**: `php spark serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080`
2. **Login as Different Users**: Use the test credentials above
3. **Navigate Through System**: Notice how menu changes based on role
4. **Test User Management**: Create/edit users based on your role permissions
5. **Check Route Protection**: Try accessing unauthorized routes
