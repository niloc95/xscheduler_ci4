🏗 The Correct Build Order (Non-Negotiable)

You must build in this sequence:

✅ PHASE 0 — Database Foundation (First)

Before writing any calendar service.

Implement:

appointments.

providers

services

working_hours

breaks

blocked_periods

customers

Add indexes immediately:

(provider_id, start_datetime)

(business_id, start_datetime)

(status)

Why first?

Because:

Availability depends on schema.

Conflict detection depends on schema.

Query performance depends on indexes.

Everything collapses if schema changes later.

👉 Do not build services before schema is stable.

✅ PHASE 1 — Conflict Detection (Integrity Layer)

Before availability.
Before rendering.
Before month view.

Implement:

AppointmentConflictService

Test:

Overlap prevention

Buffer enforcement

Break enforcement

Blocked period enforcement

Working hour enforcement

Update exclusion (id != ?)

Why second?

Because:

Rendering is useless if booking integrity is broken.

You already architected this correctly.

✅ PHASE 2 — Availability Engine

Implement:

AvailabilityService
WorkingHoursService
BreakService
BlockedPeriodService

Build:

getAvailableSlots(provider, date, service, resolution)

Test:

Full day working

Half day working

Break removal

Appointment removal

Buffers respected

Today past-time restriction

Fully booked scenario

Why now?

Because:

Month view needs hasAvailability
Day view needs slot structure
Booking UI needs slot list

Availability is shared core logic.

✅ PHASE 3 — AppointmentQueryService

Now implement:

AppointmentQueryService

Features:

Fetch by date range

Fetch by provider

Fetch by status

Group by date

Group by provider

Optimized for:

Month range queries
Week range queries
Day queries

Why now?

Because rendering engines require structured appointment grouping.

✅ PHASE 4 — CalendarRangeService

Implement:

CalendarRangeService

Must support:

generateMonthGrid() → 42 days

generateWeekRange()

normalizeDate()

This has no DB logic.
Pure date math.

Now the system can generate time boundaries cleanly.

✅ PHASE 5 — MonthViewService

Now you can safely build Month view.

Because you have:

AppointmentQueryService

AvailabilityService

CalendarRangeService

MonthViewService must:

Generate 42-day grid

Fetch all appointments in single range query

Group by date

Inject into cells

Compute flags:

isToday

isPast

hasAvailability

appointmentCount

Month view is overview only.
No heavy time-grid logic yet.

✅ PHASE 6 — TimeGridService

Now build:

TimeGridService

Responsibilities:

Generate minute grid

Compute pixelsPerMinute

Compute containerHeight

Convert time to minute offset

This is shared between:

DayView
WeekView

✅ PHASE 7 — DayViewService (Operational Engine)

Now build Day view rendering engine.

Dependencies:

AppointmentQueryService

TimeGridService

AvailabilityService

Must:

Transform appointments to positioned blocks

Handle overlap clustering

Assign columnIndex + columnSpan

Precompute:

top

height

width ratio

color

Day view is the most complex layer.

✅ PHASE 8 — WeekViewService

Very simple.

Loop DayViewService 7 times.

No duplicate logic.

If you duplicate anything → you broke architecture.

🧠 What NOT To Build Early

Do NOT start with:

❌ Day rendering
❌ Drag & drop
❌ Sticky headers
❌ CSS layout
❌ Pixel math
❌ Week view

Those come after the backend engines are stable.

📊 Visual Build Timeline
1️⃣ Database
2️⃣ Conflict Detection
3️⃣ Availability Engine
4️⃣ Appointment Query Layer
5️⃣ Calendar Range Generator
6️⃣ Month View Service
7️⃣ Time Grid Engine
8️⃣ Day View Engine
9️⃣ Week View Engine

That is the clean sequence.

🏁 Why This Order Is Correct

Because:

Integrity is guaranteed first

Availability is shared before rendering

Rendering engines rely on shared core

No refactoring later

No duplication

No broken overlap logic

No performance rewrites

This is how enterprise scheduling systems are built.

🎯 My Recommendation For You

Since WebSchedulr already exists:

Start with:

ConflictDetectionService

AvailabilityService

Then test via CLI or Postman before building UI.

Once those are correct:
You can safely build Day & Week rendering.



Please compare the rebuild /refactor.md files vs audit report, and complete phase approch to start our rebuild. 

Key I want to standardize timezone to UTC

Note we still in development phase: 

🧠 The Correct Order To Rebuild (Non-Negotiable)
Phase 1 — Controlled Extraction (Stabilize System)

DO NOT start building new calendar yet.

1️⃣ Freeze Current Calendar

Disable new feature additions

Mark legacy calendar as transitional during migration (phase-scoped), not fully deprecated yet

Add feature flag if needed

2️⃣ Database Review & Hardening

Before touching rendering:

Normalize appointment table

Confirm foreign keys:

provider_id

service_id

customer_id

Ensure proper datetime fields:

start_at (UTC)

end_at (UTC)

Index:

provider_id + start_at

start_at

status

You cannot build a correct engine on weak schema.

3️⃣ Extract Core Logic Into Services

Move logic OUT of:

Controllers

Views

AJAX handlers

Create:

App\Services\
    AvailabilityService.php
    ConflictService.php
    CalendarQueryService.php
    BookingService.php
    NotificationService.php

Controllers must become thin.

4️⃣ Centralize Booking Pipeline

All bookings (Admin + Public) must flow through:

BookingService → ConflictService → AvailabilityService → Save → NotificationService

No exceptions.

5️⃣ Lock Down User Roles

Enforce:

Admin → full access

Receptionist → limited provider scope

Provider → own appointments only

Enforce at:

Query level

Not just UI hiding

6️⃣ Integration Review

Identify where appointments touch:

Email system

SMS (if exists)

Webhooks

Google/External calendars

Reporting modules

Replace direct calls with:

Event-driven pattern:

AppointmentCreatedEvent
AppointmentUpdatedEvent
AppointmentCancelledEvent

NotificationService listens to events.

7️⃣ Public Booking Flow Validation

Public booking must:

Call AvailabilityService

Call ConflictService

Respect:

working hours

breaks

blocked periods

future booking limits

cancellation limits

Right now some of this is bypassed.

That must stop.

🚫 What NOT To Do

Do NOT:

Start redesigning UI first

Build Day/Week grid first

Refactor Tailwind styling first

Add new features before core is stabilized

Architecture first. UI second.

🏗 Correct Build Order After Cleanup

Once extraction & hardening is complete:

Availability Engine (core logic)

Conflict Detection (enforcement layer)

CalendarQueryService (data shaping)

Month View (read-only first)

Day View engine

Week View engine

Drag/drop interactions

Real-time updates

Performance optimization

🎯 Final Recommendation

You are currently in:

Pre-Engine Refactor Stage

Do this:

Step 1: Complete DB + service extraction
Step 2: Stabilize booking pipeline
Step 3: Then build new calendar engine
