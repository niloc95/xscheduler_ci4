## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. GET /api/v1/providers/:id/services

**Purpose:** Fetch all services offered by a specific provider

**File:** `app/Controllers/Api/V1/Providers.php`  
**Route:** `$routes->get('providers/(:num)/services', 'Api\\V1\\Providers::services/$1');`

**Functionality:**
- Validates provider ID and existence
- Joins `services`, `providers_services`, and `categories` tables
- Filters by provider_id and active=1 status
- Returns services with duration, price, and category information
- Orders by category name, then service name

**Request:**
```http
GET /api/v1/providers/5/services
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Haircut",
      "description": "Professional haircut service",
      "duration_min": 30,
      "price": 25.00,
      "category_id": 1,
      "category_name": "Hair Services",
      "active": true
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "providerId": 5,
    "providerName": "John Smith",
    "total": 1
  }
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- 400: Provider ID is required
- 404: Provider not found or not a provider role

**Use Cases:**
- Cascading dropdown in appointment form (provider selection → populate services)
- Dynamic service filtering based on selected provider
- Prevent invalid provider-service combinations

---

### 2. POST /api/appointments/check-availability

**Purpose:** Validate appointment time slot against conflicts

**File:** `app/Controllers/Api/Appointments.php`  
**Route:** `$routes->post('appointments/check-availability', 'Api\\Appointments::checkAvailability');`

**Functionality:**
- Validates required fields (provider_id, service_id, start_time)
- Fetches service details for duration calculation
- Checks for overlapping appointments (3 overlap scenarios)
- Validates against business hours for the day of week
- Checks for blocked times
- Suggests next available slot if unavailable

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/appointments/check-availability
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "provider_id": 5,
  "service_id": 1,
  "start_time": "2025-10-24 10:00:00",
  "appointment_id": 10  // Optional: exclude this ID when editing
}
```

**Response (Available):**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "available": true,
    "requestedSlot": {
      "provider_id": 5,
      "service_id": 1,
      "service_name": "Haircut",
      "duration_min": 30,
      "start_time": "2025-10-24 10:00:00",
      "end_time": "2025-10-24 10:30:00"
    },
    "conflicts": [],
    "businessHoursViolation": null,
    "blockedTimeConflicts": 0
  }
}
```

**Response (Unavailable):**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "available": false,
    "requestedSlot": { /* ... */ },
    "conflicts": [
      {
        "id": 25,
        "start_time": "2025-10-24 10:15:00",
        "end_time": "2025-10-24 11:00:00",
        "status": "confirmed"
      }
    ],
    "businessHoursViolation": null,
    "blockedTimeConflicts": 0,
    "suggestedNextSlot": "2025-10-24 10:30:00"
  }
}
```

**Conflict Detection:**
1. **New starts during existing:** `start_time <= requested_start < end_time`
2. **New ends during existing:** `start_time < requested_end <= end_time`
3. **New contains existing:** `requested_start <= start_time AND requested_end >= end_time`

**Business Hours Validation:**
- Checks if day is a working day
- Validates start time is within business hours
- Ensures end time doesn't exceed business hours

**Error Handling:**
- 400: Missing required fields (provider_id, service_id, start_time)
- 404: Service not found or inactive
- 500: Database or calculation errors

**Use Cases:**
- Real-time availability feedback in booking form
- Prevent double-booking before submission
- Suggest alternative time slots
- Block appointments outside business hours
- Respect provider blocked/vacation times

---

### 3. GET /api/v1/services (Provider Filter Enhancement)

**Purpose:** Filter services by provider when needed

**File:** `app/Controllers/Api/V1/Services.php`  
**Route:** `$routes->get('services', 'Api\\V1\\Services::index');` (existing)

**Enhancement:**
- Added optional `?providerId=X` or `?provider_id=X` query parameter
- When providerId is provided, joins with `providers_services` table
- Filters services to only those assigned to the specified provider
- Returns provider ID in response metadata

**Request (No Filter):**
```http
GET /api/v1/services
```

**Request (With Provider Filter):**
```http
GET /api/v1/services?providerId=5
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Haircut",
      "durationMin": 30,
      "price": 25.00,
      "active": true
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "length": 10,
    "total": 1,
    "sort": "name:ASC",
    "providerId": 5
  }
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Alternative to endpoint #1 when simpler service list needed
- Filter service catalog by currently selected provider
- Ensure service dropdown only shows available services

- **New Method:** `checkAvailability()`
- **Lines Added:** ~150
- **Database Tables:** `appointments`, `services`, `business_hours`, `blocked_times`
- **Dependencies:** AppointmentModel, Database connection, DateTime

### 3. app/Config/Routes.php

- **API Group:** v1 (provider services), unversioned (availability check)

---

## Database Queries

### Provider Services Query
```sql
SELECT 
    s.id, 
    s.name, 
    s.description, 
    s.duration_min, 
    s.price, 
    s.category_id, 
    s.active, 
    c.name as category_name
FROM services s
INNER JOIN providers_services ps ON ps.service_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN categories c ON c.id = s.category_id
WHERE ps.provider_id = ? AND s.active = 1
ORDER BY c.name ASC, s.name ASC
```

### Availability Check - Conflicts Query
```sql
SELECT * FROM appointments
WHERE provider_id = ?
  AND status != 'cancelled'
  AND (
    -- New appointment starts during existing
    (start_time <= ? AND end_time > ?)
    OR
    -- New appointment ends during existing
    (start_time < ? AND end_time >= ?)
    OR
    -- New appointment contains existing
    (start_time >= ? AND end_time <= ?)
  )
```

### Business Hours Query
```sql
SELECT * FROM business_hours
WHERE day_of_week = ?
  AND is_working_day = 1
```

### Blocked Times Query
```sql
SELECT * FROM blocked_times
WHERE provider_id = ?
  AND (
    (start_time <= ? AND end_time > ?)
    OR (start_time < ? AND end_time >= ?)
    OR (start_time >= ? AND end_time <= ?)
  )
```

---

## API Authentication

All endpoints in the `/api/v1` namespace require authentication via the `api_auth` filter. The unversioned `/api/appointments/check-availability` endpoint uses the `api_cors` filter.

**Authentication Methods:**
- Session-based (for web app)
- API token (for external integrations)

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing (via Browser/Postman)

1. **Provider Services:**
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/providers/5/services
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

2. **Availability Check:**
```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/appointments/check-availability
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "provider_id": 5,
  "service_id": 1,
  "start_time": "2025-10-24 10:00:00"
}
```

3. **Services with Provider Filter:**
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/services?providerId=5
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Test Scenarios

**Provider Services:**
- ✅ Valid provider with services
- ✅ Valid provider with no services (empty array)
- ✅ Invalid provider ID (404)
- ✅ Non-provider user ID (404)

**Availability Check:**
- ✅ Available slot (no conflicts)
- ✅ Overlapping appointment conflict
- ✅ Outside business hours
- ✅ Blocked time conflict
- ✅ Multiple conflicts
- ✅ Edit mode (exclude current appointment)
- ✅ Invalid service ID (404)

**Services Filter:**
- ✅ No filter (all services)
- ✅ Valid provider ID (filtered list)
- ✅ Provider with no services (empty array)

## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration (Pending Phase 3)

**Appointment Form (`app/Views/appointments/create.php`):**
```javascript
// 1. When provider is selected:
document.getElementById('provider_id').addEventListener('change', async (e) => {
    const providerId = e.target.value;
    const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/providers/${providerId}/services`);
    const {data} = await response.json();
    
    // Populate service dropdown
    const serviceSelect = document.getElementById('service_id');
    serviceSelect.innerHTML = data.map(service => 
        `<option value="${service.id}">${service.name} (${service.duration_min} min)</option>`
    ).join('');
});

// 2. When date/time is selected:
document.getElementById('start_time').addEventListener('blur', async (e) => {
    const formData = {
        provider_id: document.getElementById('provider_id').value,
        service_id: document.getElementById('service_id').value,
        start_time: e.target.value
    };
    
    const response = await fetch('/api/appointments/check-availability', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
        body: JSON.stringify(formData)
    });
    const {data} = await response.json();
    
    if (!data.available) {
        alert(`Time slot unavailable. Suggested: ${data.suggestedNextSlot}`);
    }
});
```

### Service Layer Integration (Phase 2)
- LocalizationSettingsService → Format time displays in 12/24 hour
- BookingSettingsService → Dynamic form field rendering
- SchedulingService → Slot generation using availability check

---

## Performance Considerations

**Database Indexes:**
- `providers_services (provider_id, service_id)` - Composite index exists ✅
- `appointments (provider_id, start_time, end_time)` - Recommended for conflict checks
- `business_hours (day_of_week)` - Recommended
- `blocked_times (provider_id, start_time, end_time)` - Recommended

**Query Optimization:**
- Provider services query uses INNER JOIN (efficient)
- Conflict detection uses indexed columns
- Business hours query is single-row lookup
- Blocked times query uses range conditions (consider index)

**Caching Opportunities (Phase 4):**
- Provider services list (cache for 5-10 minutes)
- Business hours (cache daily schedule)
- Service catalog (cache until service changes)

---

## Error Handling

All endpoints follow consistent error response format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "code": "error_code",  // Optional
    "details": "Technical details"  // Development only
  }
}
```

**HTTP Status Codes:**
- `200 OK` - Successful request
- `400 Bad Request` - Missing required fields or invalid input
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found (provider, service)
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server-side errors

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Service Layer Integration (2-3 hours)
1. Create `CalendarConfigService` to centralize calendar settings
2. Wire `LocalizationSettingsService` to calendar initialization
3. Integrate `BookingSettingsService` with appointment form for dynamic fields
4. Update calendar.js to use time format from settings

### Phase 3: Frontend Wiring (3-4 hours)
1. Implement AJAX cascading dropdowns (provider → services)
2. Add real-time availability checking in booking form
3. Dynamic form field rendering from BookingSettingsService
4. Service duration auto-calculation for end time
5. Integrate new endpoints with calendar event creation

### Phase 4: Code Optimization (1-2 hours)
1. Extract reusable form field components
2. Centralize API calls in JavaScript service layer
3. Add response caching for frequently accessed data
4. Performance testing and query optimization
5. Update mastercontext.md documentation

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Next Available Slot Algorithm:** Currently suggests +30 minutes. Should implement smarter slot finding using business hours and existing appointments.

2. **Timezone Handling:** Endpoints use server timezone. Phase 2 will integrate LocalizationSettingsService for proper timezone support.

3. **Break Times:** Availability check doesn't account for lunch breaks or other recurring provider unavailability. Consider adding `break_times` table or business_hours enhancement.

4. **Performance at Scale:** With thousands of appointments, conflict check query may be slow. Consider adding date range constraints or pagination.

5. **Concurrent Booking:** No transaction locking for simultaneous bookings. Consider implementing optimistic locking or database transactions.
