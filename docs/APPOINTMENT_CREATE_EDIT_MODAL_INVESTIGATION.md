# Appointment Create, Edit & Modal Investigation Report
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive audit of appointment creation, editing, and modal functionality  
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ **INVESTIGATION COMPLETE**

---

## Executive Summary

The appointment management system has three main interfaces:
1. **Create Form** (`/appointments/create`) - Full-page form for booking new appointments
2. **Edit Form** (`/appointments/edit/:id`) - Full-page form for modifying existing appointments
3. **Modal** (Client-side) - JavaScript modal for calendar-based appointment creation (NOT YET WIRED TO BACKEND)

### Key Finding
**Forms are functional but modal is not yet integrated.** The create/edit forms work with proper backend controller actions, but the JavaScript modal in `appointment-modal.js` is a placeholder that needs to be connected to the actual booking flow.

---

## 1. Create Appointment Form âœ…

### Location
- **View:** `app/Views/appointments/create.php`
- **Controller:** `app/Controllers/Appointments.php::create()` (loads form)
- **Store Action:** `app/Controllers/Appointments.php::store()` (processes submission)
- **Route:** `GET /appointments/create` and `POST /appointments/store`

### Features
âœ… **Dynamic Field Configuration**
- Uses `BookingSettingsService` to determine which fields to show/hide
- Fields configurable via admin settings: first_name, last_name, email, phone, address, notes
- Supports up to 6 custom fields with dynamic types (text, textarea, checkbox)
- Required/optional status driven by settings

âœ… **Role-Based Display**
- Customers: Limited fields (book for themselves)
- Staff/Provider/Admin: Full customer information fields visible

âœ… **Service Selection Flow**
1. Select Provider first
2. Service dropdown populated based on provider's available services
3. Date & time selection
4. Dynamic summary shows service details (duration, price)

âœ… **Timezone Handling**
- Hidden fields capture client timezone (`client_timezone`, `client_offset`)
- JavaScript detects browser timezone
- Backend converts local time to UTC for storage

âœ… **Customer Management**
- Checks if customer exists by email
- Creates new customer record if not found
- Links custom fields to customer profile

### Data Flow
```
User fills form
    â†“
POST /appointments/store
    â†“
Appointments::store()
    â†“
Validation rules applied
    â†“
Resolve client timezone (headers â†’ POST â†’ session â†’ settings)
    â†“
Parse date/time in client timezone
    â†“
Calculate end_time from service duration
    â†“
Convert to UTC for storage
    â†“
Find or create customer by email
    â†“
Insert appointment record
    â†“
Redirect to /appointments with success message
```

### Validation Rules
```php
'provider_id' => 'required|is_natural_no_zero'
'service_id' => 'required|is_natural_no_zero'
'appointment_date' => 'required|valid_date'
'appointment_time' => 'required'
'customer_first_name' => 'required|min_length[2]|max_length[120]'
'customer_last_name' => 'permit_empty|max_length[160]'
'customer_email' => 'required|valid_email|max_length[255]'
'customer_phone' => 'required|min_length[10]|max_length[32]'
'customer_address' => 'permit_empty|max_length[255]'
'notes' => 'permit_empty|max_length[1000]'
```

### Issues Found
ðŸ”´ **Provider Services Not Dynamically Loaded**
- Create form shows ALL services, not filtered by provider
- Needs JavaScript to fetch `/api/v1/providers/{id}/services` on provider change
- Currently just disables service dropdown until provider selected

---

## 2. Edit Appointment Form âœ…

### Location
- **View:** `app/Views/appointments/edit.php`
- **Controller:** `app/Controllers/Appointments.php::edit($id)` (loads form)
- **Update Action:** `app/Controllers/Appointments.php::update($id)` (processes submission)
- **Route:** `GET /appointments/edit/:id` and `POST /appointments/update/:id`

### Features
âœ… **Pre-Populated Fields**
- Loads existing appointment data
- Uses `old()` helper for validation error recovery
- All customer and appointment details displayed

âœ… **Additional Status Field**
- Can change appointment status: pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled, no-show
- Not available in create form (new appointments default to "booked")

âœ… **Same Dynamic Configuration**
- Uses same `BookingSettingsService` as create form
- Same custom fields support
- Same timezone handling

âœ… **Role-Based Access**
- Only accessible to: staff, provider, admin
- Customers cannot edit appointments (could be enhanced)

### Data Flow
```
User navigates to /appointments/edit/:id
    â†“
Appointments::edit($id)
    â†“
Load appointment with customer/service/provider JOINs
    â†“
Render form with pre-filled values
    â†“
User submits changes
    â†“
POST /appointments/update/:id
    â†“
Appointments::update($id)
    â†“
Validate input
    â†“
Update customer record
    â†“
Update appointment record
    â†“
Redirect with success message
```

### Issues Found
ðŸŸ¡ **Update Method Not Implemented**
- Controller has `edit()` method to show form
- But `update()` method is missing from the code shown
- Needs implementation to handle form submission
- Route is defined but controller action doesn't exist yet

---

## 3. Appointment Details Modal (View) âœ…

### Location
- **View:** `app/Views/appointments/modal.php`
- **Included in:** `app/Views/appointments/index.php`
- **JavaScript:** No wiring yet (uses placeholder `closeAppointmentModal()`)

### Features
âœ… **Loading State**
- Shows spinner while fetching appointment data

âœ… **Customer Information**
- Avatar placeholder
- Name, email, phone
- Status badge

âœ… **Appointment Details Grid**
- Service name
- Provider name
- Date & Time
- Duration
- Price
- Location (if applicable)

âœ… **Notes Section**
- Displays appointment notes if present

âœ… **Action Buttons**
- Edit button (hidden by default, shown based on role)
- Complete button (for marking complete)
- Cancel button (for cancellation)
- All buttons currently not wired to any actions

### Data Population Method
Currently expects JavaScript to:
1. Fetch appointment details via AJAX
2. Populate DOM elements by ID:
   - `modal-customer-name`
   - `modal-customer-email`
   - `modal-customer-phone`
   - `modal-status`
   - `modal-service`
   - `modal-provider`
   - `modal-datetime`
   - `modal-duration`
   - `modal-price`
   - `modal-location`
   - `modal-notes`
3. Show/hide action buttons based on user role

### Issues Found
ðŸ”´ **No JavaScript Integration**
- Modal HTML exists but no JS code populates it
- `closeAppointmentModal()` function not defined anywhere
- Clicking appointments currently redirects to `/appointments/view/:id` instead of opening modal
- Need to create modal controller in JavaScript

---

## 4. Calendar Modal for Creation (NOT IMPLEMENTED) ðŸ”´

### Location
- **JavaScript:** `resources/js/modules/scheduler/appointment-modal.js`
- **Import:** Used in `scheduler-core.js`
- **Status:** Implemented but not connected to backend

### What Exists
âœ… **AppointmentModal Class**
- Dynamic form rendering based on settings
- Time slot picker with availability
- Provider and service dropdowns
- Timezone-aware date/time selection
- Form validation

### What's Missing
ðŸ”´ **Backend Integration**
- Modal submits to `/api/appointments` (POST)
- But API route exists and expects different data format
- Need to align modal submission format with backend expectations

ðŸ”´ **API Endpoint Mismatch**
- Modal sends: `{ appointment_date, appointment_time, provider_id, service_id, customer_name, customer_email, customer_phone, notes, location }`
- Backend expects: Different field names and format (based on Appointments::store())

ðŸ”´ **Availability Checking**
- Modal tries to fetch available slots from `settingsManager.getAvailableSlots()`
- This method calls a non-existent API endpoint
- Need to implement: `GET /api/appointments/check-availability?provider_id=X&date=YYYY-MM-DD`

ðŸ”´ **Providers/Services Loading**
- Modal fetches `/api/v1/providers` - âœ… EXISTS
- Modal fetches `/api/v1/services` - ðŸ”´ DOES NOT EXIST
- Need to create: `GET /api/v1/services`

### Calendar Integration Points
The modal is called from:
- Month view: Click on empty day cell
- Week view: Click on empty time slot
- Day view: Click on empty time slot

But all these currently have `// TODO` comments instead of actual modal.open() calls.

## 5. Data Flow Comparison

### Create Form (Working)
```
Browser Form
    â†“ POST /appointments/store
Backend Controller
    â†“ Validate & Convert Timezone
Database (UTC storage)
    â†“ Redirect
Success Page
```

### Edit Form (Partially Working)
```
Browser Form (pre-filled)
    â†“ POST /appointments/update/:id
Backend Controller (MISSING)
    â†“ Would validate & update
Database
    â†“ Would redirect
Success Page (INCOMPLETE)
```

### Calendar Modal (Not Working)
```
Calendar UI
    â†“ Click empty slot
Modal Opens (âœ… works)
    â†“ Load providers (âœ… API exists)
    â†“ Load services (ðŸ”´ API missing)
    â†“ Load availability (ðŸ”´ API missing)
User fills form
    â†“ POST /api/appointments (endpoint exists but format mismatch)
Backend API
    â†“ Would validate & create
Database
    â†“ Would return JSON
Calendar refreshes (âœ… logic exists)
```

### View Modal (Not Working)
```
Calendar UI
    â†“ Click appointment
Currently: Redirects to /appointments/view/:id
Should be: Open modal
    â†“ Fetch appointment details (API exists: GET /api/appointments/:id)
Populate modal HTML
    â†“ Show action buttons
User clicks Edit/Complete/Cancel (NOT WIRED)
```

---

## 6. Missing API Endpoints

### Need to Create:
1. **`GET /api/v1/services`** - List all services
   - Should return: `[{ id, name, duration, price, category_id }]`
   - Used by: appointment-modal.js

2. **`POST /api/appointments/check-availability`** - Check time slot availability
   - Input: `{ provider_id, date, service_id? }`
   - Output: `{ available_slots: ["09:00", "09:30", "10:00", ...] }`
   - Used by: appointment-modal.js via settingsManager

3. **`PATCH /api/appointments/:id/status`** - Update appointment status
   - Already exists! (defined in Routes.php)
   - Input: `{ status: "completed|cancelled|rescheduled" }`
   - Used by: Modal action buttons

### Already Exist:
âœ… `GET /api/v1/providers` - List providers with colors
âœ… `GET /api/appointments` - List appointments
âœ… `GET /api/appointments/:id` - Get single appointment
âœ… `POST /api/appointments` - Create appointment
âœ… `PATCH /api/appointments/:id` - Update appointment
âœ… `DELETE /api/appointments/:id` - Delete appointment

  - Need to create: `app/Controllers/Api/V1/Services.php` - Services API

- **Views:**
  - `app/Views/appointments/create.php` - Create form
  - `app/Views/appointments/edit.php` - Edit form  
  - `app/Views/appointments/modal.php` - View details modal HTML
  - `app/Views/appointments/index.php` - List page (includes modal)

- **Services:**
  - `app/Services/BookingSettingsService.php` - Field configuration
  - `app/Services/LocalizationSettingsService.php` - Timezone/format settings
  - `app/Services/TimezoneService.php` - Timezone conversion
  - Need to create: `app/Services/SchedulingService.php` - Availability logic

### Frontend (JavaScript)
- **Calendar Integration:**
  - `resources/js/app.js` - Main initialization
  - `resources/js/modules/scheduler/scheduler-core.js` - Scheduler orchestrator
  - `resources/js/modules/scheduler/appointment-modal.js` - Creation modal (EXISTS, NOT WIRED)
  - `resources/js/modules/scheduler/scheduler-month-view.js` - Month view clicks

---

## 10. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete the update() method** - Edit form is broken without it
2. **Create Services API** - Calendar modal can't load services
3. **Wire calendar to modal** - Replace TODO comments with actual open() calls

### Short-term Goals
4. **Implement availability API** - Users need to see available slots
5. **Add view modal JavaScript** - Currently just redirects, should open modal
6. **Dynamic service filtering** - Create form should filter by provider

### Long-term Enhancements
7. **Recurring appointments** - Pattern-based scheduling
8. **Waitlist management** - When slots are full
9. **Appointment reminders** - Email/SMS notifications
10. **Drag-and-drop rescheduling** - From calendar view
11. **Multi-step wizard** - Better UX for create form
12. **Conflict detection** - Warn about double-bookings
