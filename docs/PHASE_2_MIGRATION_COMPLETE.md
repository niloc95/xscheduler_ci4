# Phase 2 Migration Complete: Legacy Scheduler Isolation

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  
**Next Phase:** Phase 3 - Create New Appointment View Skeleton

---

## Overview

Phase 2 of the scheduler migration has been completed successfully. All legacy FullCalendar-based scheduler code has been isolated into clearly marked "legacy" directories with comprehensive deprecation warnings. The system remains fully functional while being prepared for replacement.

## What Was Done

### 1. Documentation Created
- **File:** `docs/architecture/LEGACY_SCHEDULER_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Size:** 500+ lines
- **Content:** Comprehensive documentation of the current scheduler system including:
  - Complete architecture flow diagram
  - Full file inventory with sizes and purposes
  - API endpoints and data flows
  - Dependencies and performance metrics
  - Migration timeline and phases
  - Known limitations and improvement opportunities

### 2. Files Reorganized

#### JavaScript Files Moved to Legacy Subdirectories:
```
BEFORE:
resources/js/scheduler-dashboard.js (1275 lines)
resources/js/services/scheduler-service.js (191 lines)

AFTER:
resources/js/modules/scheduler-legacy/scheduler-dashboard.js
resources/js/services/scheduler-legacy/scheduler-service.js
```

#### View Templates Moved:
```
BEFORE:
app/Views/scheduler/index.php (235 lines)

AFTER:
app/Views/scheduler-legacy/index.php
```

### 3. Deprecation Headers Added

All legacy files now include comprehensive deprecation warnings:

**JavaScript Files:**
- `scheduler-dashboard.js`: 14-line header explaining deprecation status
- `scheduler-service.js`: 14-line header explaining deprecation status

**View Templates:**
- `scheduler-legacy/index.php`: 14-line HTML comment explaining deprecation

**Controller:**
- `Scheduler.php`: 16-line docblock explaining deprecation status

Each header includes:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning symbol for visibility
- Clear deprecation notice
- Current status (Active but will be replaced)
- Timeline information
- Policy: "DO NOT add new features" - only bug fixes
- Link to architecture documentation
- Reference to replacement location
- Last updated date

### 4. Build Configuration Updated

**File:** `vite.config.js`

```javascript
// ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED: Legacy Scheduler (FullCalendar-based)
// Will be replaced by new Appointment View system
// See: docs/architecture/LEGACY_SCHEDULER_ARCHITECTURE.md
'scheduler-dashboard': 'resources/js/modules/scheduler-legacy/scheduler-dashboard.js',
```

### 5. Import Paths Corrected

Updated all internal imports in moved files to reflect new directory structure:
- CSS imports: `../../../css/fullcalendar-overrides.css`
- Service imports: `../../services/scheduler-legacy/scheduler-service`

### 6. Controller Updated

**File:** `app/Controllers/Scheduler.php`

Changed view path from `scheduler/index` to `scheduler-legacy/index`:
```php
return view('scheduler-legacy/index', [
    'services' => $services,
    'providers' => $providers,
]);
```

## Testing & Verification

### ‚úÖ Build Test
```bash
npm run build
```
**Result:** Success (1.61s)
- All assets compiled correctly
- No import resolution errors
- Output files:
  - `scheduler-dashboard.js`: 291.90 kB (84.20 kB gzipped)
  - `scheduler-dashboard.css`: 15.68 kB (2.69 kB gzipped)

### ‚úÖ File Structure Verified
```bash
find resources/js -name "*scheduler*" -type f
find app/Views -name "*scheduler*" -type d
```
All files confirmed in correct legacy locations.

### ‚úÖ Git Status
Working tree shows all expected changes:
- Modified: `vite.config.js`
- Modified: `app/Controllers/Scheduler.php`
- Renamed: 3 files to legacy subdirectories
- New file: `docs/architecture/LEGACY_SCHEDULER_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- New file: This summary

- `/api/v1/appointments/*` ‚Üí REST API endpoints
- `/api/slots` ‚Üí Available time slot calculation
- `/api/book` ‚Üí Public booking submission

### Features Still Working
‚úÖ FullCalendar day/week/month views  
‚úÖ Appointment CRUD operations  
‚úÖ Service and provider filtering  
‚úÖ Color-coded appointments

| `scheduler-service.js` | `resources/js/services/scheduler-legacy/` | 191 lines | API wrapper |
| `index.php` | `app/Views/scheduler-legacy/` | 235 lines | View template |
| `Scheduler.php` | `app/Controllers/` | 126 lines | Controller |

### Supporting Files (Still Active)

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `AppointmentModel.php` | `app/Models/` | Database operations |
| `ServiceModel.php` | `app/Models/` | Service data |

## Dependencies

### Locked (Do Not Upgrade Until Phase 8)
- `@fullcalendar/core`: ^6.1.15
- `@fullcalendar/daygrid`: ^6.1.15
- `@fullcalendar/timegrid`: ^6.1.15
- `@fullcalendar/interaction`: ^6.1.15

**Reason:** These are part of the legacy system. Upgrading could introduce breaking changes. They will be removed entirely in Phase 8.

### Safe to Update
- All other npm packages
- All composer packages
- CodeIgniter framework

---

## Developer Guidelines

### For Bug Fixes in Legacy System

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Fix critical bugs affecting users
- Apply security patches
- Update comments for clarity
- Test thoroughly

‚ùå **DO NOT:**
- Add new features
- Refactor code extensively
- Change core logic
- Introduce new dependencies

### For New Feature Requests

All new calendar/scheduling features should be:
1. Documented as requirements for Phase 5
2. Added to `docs/architecture/NEW_APPOINTMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
3. Prioritized in Phase 5 backlog
4. NOT implemented in legacy system

### For Code Reviews

When reviewing PRs that touch scheduler code:
1. Verify changes are to legacy directories
2. Ensure deprecation headers remain intact
3. Check that no new features were added
4. Confirm tests still pass
5. Verify build succeeds

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered, rollback is straightforward:

### To Revert This Phase:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
npm run build
```

### Manual Revert (if needed):
1. Move files back to original locations:
   ```bash
   mv resources/js/modules/scheduler-legacy/scheduler-dashboard.js \
      resources/js/scheduler-dashboard.js
   mv resources/js/services/scheduler-legacy/scheduler-service.js \
      resources/js/services/scheduler-service.js
   mv app/Views/scheduler-legacy/index.php \
      app/Views/scheduler/index.php
   ```

2. Revert `vite.config.js` entry point:
   ```javascript
   'scheduler-dashboard': 'resources/js/scheduler-dashboard.js',
   ```

3. Revert `Scheduler.php` view path:
   ```php
   return view('scheduler/index', [
   ```

4. Remove deprecation headers (optional)

5. Rebuild:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Can we still make changes to the scheduler?**  
A: Yes, but only bug fixes and security updates. New features go in the new system.

**Q: When will the new system be ready?**  
A: Timeline TBD. Phase 3-5 will take several weeks minimum. Phase 6-7 add testing time.

**Q: What if users report issues?**  
A: Fix them in the legacy system for now. Log as requirements for new system.

**Q: Can we upgrade FullCalendar?**  
A: No. It's frozen until Phase 8 removal.

**Q: Will URLs change?**  
A: Not immediately. `/scheduler` will redirect to `/appointments` in Phase 7. Old URLs can be preserved with redirects.
