## Historical Issues & Resolutions

### 1. Calendar Time Format Not Syncing

**Symptom:** Calendar displays time format (12-hour vs 24-hour) not matching system settings.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check database: `SELECT * FROM xs_settings WHERE setting_key = 'calendar_time_format'`
2. Verify browser cache cleared
3. Check TimeFormatService initialization
4. Verify CalendarConfigService API response

**Root Cause:** Settings change not triggering calendar refresh.

**Resolution:** 
- Settings observer listens for changes
- Automatic calendar re-initialization
- Browser cache invalidation

**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED (Oct 21, 2025)

## Lessons for Future Development

| Issue Category | Lesson | Best Practice |
|---------------|--------|----------------|
| Data Sync | Settings must invalidate caches | Use Observer pattern |
| Time Handling | Always timezone-aware | Use standard library |
| Calendar Rendering | Height must be explicit | Set min-height + responsive |
| Form Handling | State must reset after submit | Clear form after success |
| API Integration | Validate response format | Use strict validation |
