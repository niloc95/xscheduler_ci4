   - Enable: Restrict pushes
   - Disable: Allow force pushes
   - Disable: Allow deletions

2. **Enable GitHub Security Features:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Security & Analysis
   - ‚úÖ Dependency Scanning
   - ‚úÖ Secret Scanning  
   - ‚úÖ Code Scanning (if available)
   - ‚úÖ Private vulnerability reporting

3. **Review Access Control:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Manage Access
   - Remove unnecessary collaborators
   - Verify all users have 2FA enabled
   - Use teams for granular permissions

#### Production Deployment Security:
1. **Environment Configuration:**
