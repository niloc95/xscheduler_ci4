 * @return int Appointment ID
 * @throws ValidationException
 */
public function createAppointment(array $data): int
{
    // Implementation
}
```

### File Naming
- Controllers: `PascalCase.php` (e.g., `AppointmentController.php`)
- Models: `PascalCase.php` (e.g., `AppointmentModel.php`)
- Views: `kebab-case.php` (e.g., `appointment-form.php`)
- Folders: `kebab-case` (e.g., `customer-management/`)

### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ syntax
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep functions small and focused
